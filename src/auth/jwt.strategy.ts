  // For example, we could do a database lookup in our validate() method to extract more information about the user, resulting in a more enriched user object being available in our Request. This is also the place we may decide to do further token validation, such as looking up the userId in a list of revoked tokens, enabling us to perform token revocation. The model we've implemented here in our sample code is a fast, "stateless JWT" model, where each API call is immediately authorized based on the presence of a valid JWT, and a small bit of information about the requester (its userId and username) is available in our Request pipeline.

    const user = await this.usersService.findById(payload.sub);
